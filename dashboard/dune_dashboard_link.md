\## How This Fits the Pipeline



This dashboard represents the \*\*final analytics layer\*\* of the pipeline:

\- Python ETL → raw transaction ingestion

\- dbt-style transformations → analytics-ready tables

\- Dune SQL → visualization \& business insights



> Note: The dashboard queries data produced by the upstream pipeline and is

maintained separately on Dune Analytics.
